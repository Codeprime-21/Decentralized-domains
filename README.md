You might have seen many people's username as something.eth
that .eth at the end directly represents the crypto wallet address of that individual
Crypto boom is really high these days and no one wants to delay their in/outgoing transactions which might be caused by the sender dming the reciever to send their wallet address.
It's hard to imagine that right!
So, that's why crypto wallet address which are normally in hexadecimals are converted to pure english. and the top level domain (.eth) represents the main crypto account of the receiver.
hence, people can directly receive assets without any delay.
Another use case is that, people can even use that as a decentralized domain or site where they can attach their important links, so that public can access them.
Now, purchasing such web3 domains costs eternity and costly gas fees for every change you make. That too as long as you maintain the domain.
Hence, I started this project to create my own domain with my own tld!
This is just a glimpse of the project. I have something more to achieve and complete this project.
I will make sure to update this README.md file once I finish everything.
CHEERS!!!
